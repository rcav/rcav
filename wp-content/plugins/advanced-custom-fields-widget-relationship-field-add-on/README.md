#About

This plugin is an add-on for Advanced Custom Fields. It allows you to use an ACF "relationship" field to choose widgets at a page level.


# Installation

Create a folder named `advanced-custom-fields-widget-relationship-field-add-on` in your `plugins` directory. Unzip and copy files to this directory. Activate plugin in WP admin.

#Usage

## Edit your template`s sidebar file(s)

In `sidebar.php`, replace default `dynamic_sidebar()` function with the new `dynamic_widgets()` method:

    if ( ! acf_Widget::dynamic_widgets( 'Side Bar' ) ) {

       //fallback to default function if you like
       dynamic_sidebar( 'Side Bar' );

    }

## Add new ACF Field

Add a new ACF field to your ACF Field Group. Select `Widget Relationship` from the field type option. Set the `Sidebar`, `Inherit From` and `Menu Location` options as desired.

## Configure your widgets

In WP Admin, go to `Appearance`, then `Widgets` and configure ALL widgets you'd like to use. This will be your "pool" of available widgets.

## Select desired widgets from the page level

Assuming you applied the ACF Field Group to the `page` post type, in WP Admin, go to `Pages`, then edit a page. You should have a new relationship field for each sidebar set to use a Widget Relationship field. Select the widgets you'd like to display on the page - select `----Inherit from Parent----` to include all of the parent page's widgets as well. Drag the options around to sort them in your preferred order.
